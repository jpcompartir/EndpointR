This vignette shows how to generate text embeddings using EndpointR with both Hugging Face and OpenAI providers.

# What are Text Embeddings?

Text embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Think of them as coordinates in a high-dimensional space where similar texts are closer together. They're the foundation for:

-   Semantic search
-   Clustering similar documents\
-   Finding duplicates
-   Building recommendation systems
-   Powering RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications

EndpointR makes it easy to generate embeddings from your text data using either Hugging Face or OpenAI APIs.

# Setup

library(EndpointR)
```
