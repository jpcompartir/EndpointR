\title{Execute a single embedding request and process the response}
\usage{
hf_perform_request(request, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{request}{An httr2 request object created by hf_build_request}

\item{...}{ellipsis is sent to \code{httr2::req_perform}, e.g. for \code{path} and \code{verbosity} arguments.}
}
\value{
An httr2 response object. Check status with httr2::resp_status().
}
\description{
Performs a prepared request and returns the response.
Since requests use req_error(is_error = ~ FALSE), HTTP error responses
(status >= 400) are returned rather than thrown as errors.
}
