\title{Perform multiple requests with configurable concurrency strategy}
\usage{
perform_requests_with_strategy(
  requests,
  concurrent_requests = 1,
  progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{requests}{List of httr2_request objects to perform}

\item{concurrent_requests}{Integer specifying maximum number of simultaneous requests (default: 1)}

\item{progress}{Logical indicating whether to show progress bar (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
List of httr2_response objects (check status with resp_status()) or error objects for network failures
}
\description{
Executes a list of HTTP requests either sequentially or in parallel.
Automatically chooses sequential processing when concurrent_requests = 1
or when there's only one request.
}
\details{
Returns responses in the order that requests were sent.
Since requests use req_error(is_error = ~ FALSE), HTTP error responses (status >= 400)
are returned as httr2_response objects rather than being thrown as errors.
Callers should check response status with httr2::resp_status() or use
httr2::resps_successes() / httr2::resps_failures() to categorise responses.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Sequential processing
  responses <- perform_requests_with_strategy(
    requests = my_requests,
    concurrent_requests = 1
  )

  # Parallel processing with 5 concurrent requests
  responses <- perform_requests_with_strategy(
    requests = my_requests,
    concurrent_requests = 5,
    progress = TRUE
  )
}
}
